          Random smatterings before you begin: 
 -stick "view-source:" before https in a browser to see 
  the source 
 -cmd + shf + c = open up inspect shortcut 
 -onthe dev tools pane, next to "elements" there is an arrow
  icon, click that so that as your cursor scrolls over the
  "content pane" the html on the side it corresponds to pops
  up 
 -in the Chrome JS console, the clear() method clears out 
  the console of the wraning and text. HOWEVER it still
  retains all the values entered in that session, it just 
  keeps them behind the scenes. to start fresh, refresh.
 --the shorcut is cmd + k, or ctl + L
