# Lisp Notes 
These notes are coming from the free Lisp book http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/

# Chapter 2 
This book is hella out of date and the software for lisp-in-a-box no longer seems to work, use https://portacle.github.io/ instead (it's a pain to open with macs the first time, but once you finally get it onto your dock and open it from there, it will work. (copy the file from the .dmg into your applications folder as well) 

## Emacs 
In order to get the SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) working you will need to use Emacs. Here are some handy key bindings 

The little line at the bottom where the meta commands go is called the
"mini-buffer"
C-g C-g   abandon meta commands

NAVIGATION
C-v       Page down
M-v       Page up
C-l       that's the L key, and it makes it scrolls up/down so centered of screen

				  :
				  :
   Backward, C-b .... Current cursor position .... Forward, C-f

M-f       Move forward by word
M-b       Move backward by word 
C-a       Move to start of line
C-e       Move to end of line

C-w       Cut  (Kill-region)
M-w       Copy (Kill-ring-save)
C-y       Paste (yank)
M-y       Paster older things
C-/       Undo


C-x C-c   Quit emacs
