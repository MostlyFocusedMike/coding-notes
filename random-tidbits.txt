-When aligning <ul> elements, the <li> won't be 
properly centered unless you set the <ul> pad to
0. They have a weird offset
-remove cirlces from the <li> by setting 
list-style: none
-If you're using flex to center your list items,
  you don't need to set them to inline, but set 
  them to block if you want more control about
  spacing 

-With justify-content: space-around it will 
  decide the distance between items, if you
  want to control it, use justify-content: 
  center, and then assign each item your
  desired margin

-when using flex, all containers must 
  have discernable widths and heights to get 
  the alignments right

-When alignment is weird,
  - make sure it's block (or if
    you were looking for inline, that) 
  - and make sure the padding is 0 
  - and the margin is 0 if needed
