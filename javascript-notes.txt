review:

OBJECT ORIENTED: objects are MODELED with data
    and each time one appears it is called an 
    INSTANCE.

PROPERTIES: characteristcs of an object, each
    property has a variable and a value.

EVENT: When a user interacts with a program and 
    triggers a reaction

METHODS: functions that are defined in an object


*Web browsers are object oriented*
    -the browser represents each window and tab 
     using a WINDOW OBJECT 
        -The location property has the URL as 
         the value
    -The current web page loaded in the 
     browser is modeled using the 
     DOCUMENT OBJECT


*The Document Object represents an HTML page*
    -Using the Document Object you can access
     and change what the user sees on the page.
    -It has properties, events, and methods from
     the HTML code
    -The Document Object is just one of a set of
     objects all browsers support. 
    -When a browser creates the document object
     of a webpage, it also creates a new object
     for every element on the page
    -together, all thes objects create the 
     DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (ch. 5 for more)


*How a browser sees a page*
1. recieve page html code
    -these are the individual HTML documents
2. create the DOM (document object model) of 
   the page and store it in memory:

    DOCUMENT   top is the DOCUMENT OBJECT, each
       |       item below is both a node and an
    <HTML>     object.
       |-----------------------|
    <HEAD>                  <BODY>
       |--------|              |---------|
    <TITLE>  <LINK>           <h1>      <p>
       |        |              |         |
     name      css            text     text 

3. Use a rendering engine to display the page
    -if no css is linked to it, it will display
     presets
