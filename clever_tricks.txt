**always keep a value between a max and min**
 CONTEXT 
 -you want to add to a value, but it has a max and min
 -if you add too much, you want to let it hit max but no
  higher, and if you subtract too much then it will hit min
  but no lower: 

    bill.happy_gauge = 5
    bill.happy_gauge += 50
    # what we want it to be is 
    bill.happy_gauge
    #=> 10

 ANSWER 
 -use the following setter: 

    class Person
    ....

    def happy_gauge=(num)
      @happy_gauge = num
      @happy_gauge = [@happy_gauge,0,10].sort[1]
    end

 -so what that does is set happy_gauge to be the number,
  but then it runs a sort of check on the value
 -if happy gauge is over ten, when the array is sorted, it
  will go to index 2, and 10 goes in the middle. #sort then
  returns the index 1, which is 10,
 -if happy gauge is between 1 and 10, #sort returns the middle
  index, so it just stays the same value 
 -and if happy guage is LOWER than 0, then it will go into 
  index 0, and the value 0 is now at the middle index, 
  so that's what sort[1] returns
