OVERVIEW 

-browsers can open .html files from the desktop because the browser can read html, css,
and js
-to use php, you have to use a .php file, you can’t just put php code in an html file
 php has to be read by the server 
-mac has PHP and Apache installed, you just needed to turn them on
-to access that local server, put your index.php file in /Library/WebServer/Documents 
 and in your browser type localhost 
-if theres a folder that you want to parse, it would be localhost/your-folder 
-this server can read .html and whatnot 
-you DO need to download mySQL



Use just apache on MacBook: 

https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/setup-local-web-server-apache-php-osx-yosemite.html
-this site gives step by step instructions on setting up a local Sites folder in ~/ 
 which keeps you from needing to sudo everything in the /Library/WebServer folder 


LOADING MYSQL THE RIGHT WAY
brew install mysql
// let it do it’s thing and download 
// then do
mysql.server start 
// this is what the video does in the GUI by waiting for it to show up in preferences
