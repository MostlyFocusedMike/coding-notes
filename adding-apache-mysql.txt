OVERVIEW 

-browsers can open .html files from the desktop because the browser can read html, css,
and js
-to use php, you have to use a .php file, you can’t just put php code in an html file
 php has to be read by the server 
-mac has PHP and Apache installed, you just needed to turn them on
-to access that local server, put your index.php file in /Library/WebServer/Documents 
 and in your browser type localhost 
-if theres a folder that you want to parse, it would be localhost/your-folder 
-this server can read .html and whatnot 
-you DO need to download mySQL



Use just apache on MacBook: 

https://ole.michelsen.dk/blog/setup-local-web-server-apache-php-osx-yosemite.html
-this site gives step by step instructions on setting up a local Sites folder in ~/ 
 which keeps you from needing to sudo everything in the /Library/WebServer folder 


XAMPP
-this seems to be an app used more by linux and windows users since mac has the above 
	built in apache 
-start the program, start the stuff, volumes tab then hit mount, then explore and then
 copy whatever file you want to run on the server into htdocs 
-now to access do localhost:8080/your-directory-name
-if you just do localhost:8080 it goes to the index already in there, which is an xampp
 help page, but you could delete it 

LOADING MYSQL THE RIGHT WAY


brew install mysql
// let it do it’s thing and download 
// then do
mysql.server start 
// this is what the video does in the GUI by waiting for it to show up in preferences 

Directions from the youtube video 


- sudo apachectl start  ( start apache )
- sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf ( opening editor, scroll down and delete hashtag in line "LoadModule php_5_module ... "
 - sudo apachectl restart ( restart apache )
- Download MySQL and install it, note the password given during the installation
- Start MySQL in the system preferences
- cd /usr/local/mysql/bin ( navigate to mysql bin folder)
- ./mysql -u root -p ( then password given in installation) ( starting MySQL)
- alter user "root"@"localhost" identified by "NEW PASSWORD"; ( changes mysql password to password in last field )
- Download phpMyAdmin
- Extract in /Library/WebServer/Documents and rename phpmyadmin
- cd /Library/WebServer/Documents ( navigate to webserver)
- sudo chmod o+x phpmyadmin/ ( give folders some rights )
- cd phpmyadmin ( navigate into phpmyadmin)
- mkdir config ( create config folder )
- sudo chmod o+x config ( give folder some rights )
- Open browser and go to localhost/phpmyadmin/setup
- Click on "New Server" and in the authentication tab, enter the password in the password field under "root"
- sudo mkdir /var/mysql ( create mysql folder in /var)
- sudo ln -s /tmp/ var/mysql/mysql.sock ( create symlink )

here are all the sites you used when messing around:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_6g_5S_bVo
-main video you used, except you downloaded xampp instead of phpadmin

https://jason.pureconcepts.net/2015/10/install-apache-php-mysql-mac-os-x-el-capitan/
-helped get apache going 


https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/get-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-working-on-osx-10-11-el-capitan/
-this one was where you understood how to use local host
